# Data-plane Analyzer

Tool that receives network packets, filters the packets having the same UID (payload) and computes *flow trees* from the set of filtered packets.

## Algorithm's Intuition

**Input** Represented by triples *(s, i , t)* where *s âˆˆ S*, *i* is the interface at the node *s* where the packet is observed, and *t* is the timestamp when the observation occurred

**Output** Flow trees, which are a graphical representation of a set of data-paths from the same origin

1. Sort the observations(packets) by their timestamp
2. Create a tree with the root labeled with *h*
3. Keeping track of the time of packet ingress (TI) and egress (TE) properly "hang" the child nodes from the observations
4. Create a set of paths by doing a depth-first-search from the root to each of the leaves

> A detailed algorithm can be found in the [paper][1]
